        Being a web framework, Django needs a convenient way to generate HTML 
        dynamically. The most common approach relies on templates. A template 
        contains the static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some 
        special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.
        
        A Django project can be configured with one or several template engines
        (or even zero if you donâ€™t use templates). Django ships built-in 
        backends for its own template system, creatively called the Django 
        template language (DTL), and for the popular alternative Jinja2. 
        Backends for other template languages may be available from 
        third-parties.
